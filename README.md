# ObjectScan - 3D Object Scanning App

## Overview
ObjectScan is a Flutter mobile application that scans real-world objects using device cameras and generates 3D models. The app features a sleek, modern UI with advanced scanning capabilities and 3D model interaction.

## Core Features (MVP)
1. **Camera Scanning Interface** - Multi-angle object capture
2. **3D Model Generation** - Point cloud to mesh conversion
3. **3D Model Viewer** - Interactive model preview with rotation/zoom
4. **Basic Editing Tools** - Scale, rotate, basic adjustments
5. **Export Functionality** - Save models locally
6. **Gallery Management** - View and manage scanned models

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Camera Module** (`lib/services/camera_service.dart`)
   - Handle camera permissions and initialization
   - Multi-angle capture with guidance overlays
   - Image quality optimization

2. **3D Processing Engine** (`lib/services/model_processor.dart`)
   - Point cloud generation from images
   - Basic mesh reconstruction algorithms
   - Model optimization for mobile viewing

3. **3D Renderer** (`lib/widgets/model_viewer.dart`)
   - Custom 3D model display widget
   - Touch interactions (rotate, zoom, pan)
   - Shader-based rendering

4. **Storage Manager** (`lib/services/storage_service.dart`)
   - Local file management for models
   - Export to common formats (OBJ, STL)
   - Model metadata persistence

### Data Models
- `ScanSession` - Active scanning session data
- `Model3D` - 3D model representation and metadata
- `CameraFrame` - Individual camera capture data
- `ExportFormat` - Export configuration and formats

### Screen Structure
1. **Home Screen** - Model gallery and scan initiation
2. **Scan Screen** - Camera interface with AR guides
3. **Processing Screen** - Model generation progress
4. **Viewer Screen** - 3D model interaction and editing
5. **Export Screen** - Format selection and sharing options

## Implementation Constraints
- Maximum 12 files total for MVP
- Focus on core 3D scanning functionality
- Use native Flutter capabilities where possible
- Simplified AR guidance using camera overlay
- Basic 3D reconstruction using point cloud algorithms
- Local storage only (no cloud processing in MVP)

## Technical Dependencies
- `camera` - Camera access and controls
- `path_provider` - File system access
- `flutter_3d_controller` - 3D model rendering
- `sensors_plus` - Device orientation for scanning guidance
- `permission_handler` - Camera and storage permissions

## Success Metrics
- Successful multi-angle object capture
- Basic 3D model generation from photos
- Interactive 3D model viewing
- Local model storage and export
- Smooth, intuitive user experience

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- ARKit/ARCore integration
- Cloud-based high-quality reconstruction
- Advanced editing tools
- Social sharing features
- Texture mapping capabilities
